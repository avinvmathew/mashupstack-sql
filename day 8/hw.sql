-- Imagine you are helping a small bookstore manage their online inventory system. Your job is to set up the 
-- database structure for their books and authors. Follow these steps:

-- Create a new database called BookStoreDB.

CREATE DATABASE BookStoreDB;

-- Select this database to work on.

USE bookstoredb;

-- Create a table named authors with the following columns:
-- author_id (number, primary key)
-- name (text)
-- country (text)

CREATE TABLE authors( author_id int(5) PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), country varchar(255) );

-- Create another table named books with the following columns:
-- book_id (number, primary key)
-- title (text)
-- price (number)
-- author_id (foreign key referencing authors)

CREATE TABLE books( book_id int(5) PRIMARY KEY, title varchar(255), price int(5), author_id int, FOREIGN KEY(author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id) );

-- Add a new column called published_year (number) to the books table.

ALTER TABLE books ADD published_year int;

-- Delete all rows from the books table without removing the table itself.

TRUNCATE TABLE books;

-- Remove the BookStoreDB completely from the system.

DROP DATABASE bookstoredb;
