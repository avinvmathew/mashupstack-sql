-- You are setting up a simple online system for a small grocery shop. Your task is to:

-- Create a new database called GroceryShop.

create DATABASE GroceryShop;

-- Use that database.

USE groceryshop;

-- Create a table named products with the following details:
-- product_id (number, should be the main identifier)
-- product_name (text)
-- price (number)

CREATE TABLE products( product_id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, product_name varchar(255), price int(5) );

-- Later, you are asked to add a new column called category (text) to the same table.

ALTER TABLE products ADD category varchar(255);

-- The shop owner wants to remove all items from the products table without deleting the table itself.

TRUNCATE TABLE products;

-- Finally, delete the entire database as it’s no longer needed.

DROP DATABASE groceryshop;
